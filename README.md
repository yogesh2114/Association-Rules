# Association-Rules

Association rule learning is a rule-based unsupervised machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large datasets . They play an important part in customer analytics, market basket analysis, product clustering.

Prepare rules for the all the data sets:

1.Try different values of support and confidence. Observe the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values

2.Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm

3.Visulize the obtained rules using different plots
